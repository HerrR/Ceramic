All changes should be developed in a new branch created from the `master` branch.

Branches use the following naming conventions:
* `add/{something}` => When you are adding a completely new feature
* `update/{something}` => When you are iterating on an existing feature
* `fix/{something}` => When you are fixing something broken in a feature
* `try/{something}` => When you are trying out an idea and want feedback
